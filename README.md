# Snake Client Project

Are you ready to embark on a slithery adventure? 🐍 Snake, the classic video game where you guide a dot through a pixelated world, is back and ready to bring some hiss-terical fun to your day!

In this game, you'll be the master of maneuvering. Your dot will grow as it munches on delicious pixel snacks, but be warned – with great growth comes great challenges. Your ever-expanding snake might become its own worst enemy.

The goal? Navigate your serpent around the screen, avoiding walls and, of course, your own snaky self, while eating blocks. Can you grow your reptilian companion to legendary proportions, or will you find yourself in a knot of trouble?

But wait, there's more! This version adds a twist: multiplayer! Compete with other players to see whose snake reigns supreme. Will your snake slither its way to the top or become a tangled mess of regret?
